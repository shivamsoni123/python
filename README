Python impl for TextRank

A pure Python implementation of TextRank, based on the Mihalcea 2004 paper. This work leads toward integration with the Williams 2016 talk on text summarization.

Modifications to the original Mihalcea algorithm include:

fixed bug; see Java impl, 2008
use of lemmatization instead of stemming
verbs included in the graph (but not in the resulting keyphrases)
normalized keyphrase ranks used in summarization
Dependencies and Installation

This code has dependencies on several other Python projects:

NLTK
TextBlob
NetworkX
datasketch
To install:

conda config --add channels https://conda.binstar.org/sloria
conda install textblob
pip install -U git+https://github.com/sloria/textblob-aptagger.git@dev
sudo python -m nltk.downloader punkt
sudo python -m nltk.downloader wordnet
pip install datasketch -U
Example Usage

Run a test case based on the Mihalcea paper:

./stage1.py dat/mih.json > out1.json
./stage2.py out1.json > out2.json
That test case should result as:

0.2230    minimal supporting set
0.1345    types systems
0.1339    linear diophantine equations
0.0802    mixed types
0.0541    strict inequations
0.0505    nonstrict inequations
0.0368    linear constraints
0.0356    natural numbers
0.0252    corresponding algorithms
0.0116    upper bounds
0.0091    solutions
0.0027    components
0.0025    construction
0.0014    compatibility
0.0010    criteria
Run another test based on Williams, using text from a Wired article:

./stage1.py dat/ars.json > out1.json
./stage2.py out1.json > out2.json
./stage3.py out1.json out2.json > out3.json
./stage4.py out2.json out3.json > out4.md
Which produces as a summary:

excerpts: The surprisingly skillful Google machine, known as AlphaGo, now needs only one more win to claim victory in the match. The Korean-born Lee Sedol will go down in defeat unless he takes each of the match's last three games. Lee Sedol is widely-regarded as the top Go player of the last decade, after winning more international titles than all but one other player. Although AlphaGo topped Lee Sedol in the match's first game on Wednesday afternoon, the outcome of Game Two was no easier to predict. In his 1996 match with IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer, world chess champion Gary Kasparov lost the first game but then came back to win the second game and, eventually, the match as a whole.

These results show a summarization similar to slide 30 of the talk; however, this approach is more amenable to:

bootstrapping work with new documents about a specific topic
producing results ready for use in a search engine or recommender system
TODO: Stay tuned for more...

Integrate sent2vec encoder
Integrate keras for RNN (deep learning)
LSH for building doc-to-doc graph of semantic similarity (per chapter-ish)
Docker container for managing the installation/dependencies
